## BASE IMAGES
### Client and Backend
I used alpine image as the base for the client and the backend.To also further reduce the size, I used multistage builds on the dockerfile and set the environment to be production to remove unneeded dependencies. 

### Database 
For the database I used the official image provided by Mongo. The image size cannot be optimized further.
